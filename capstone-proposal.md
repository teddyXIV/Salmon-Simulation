# Capstone Proposal 

## Student: 
### Teddy Peterschmidt

## Name of Project:
### Salmon Simulation

## Purpose:
Provide a visualization of Chinook Salmon migration up the Columbia River and its' tributaries. Enable citizen scientists and fisherfolks to estimate where fish are using nearly real time data. 

## Features:
* A map of the Columbia River that runs a UI friendly simulation. 
* Selectable date ranges to adjust the time period that the simulation shows. 
* Interactable points on the map the provide additional context and information.

## Tools and Tech: 
* React 
* Mapbox GL
* Python
* Web Scraping tools i.e. BeautifulSoup 
* FireBase 

## Potential Additional Features: 
* Additional data to enhance simulation accuracy. 
    * Weather
    * Catch records of recreational fisherfolks

## Tools and Tech for Additional Features:
* OpenWeather API
